# Stock Prediction Package

## Dependencies

All the dependencies of the project are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, we recommend to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv/
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To quit the virtual environment just run:

```bash
deactivate
```

## Usage

The main functions are in the `methods/predict.py` file.
In order to use them in a script import the package with:

```python
import methods.predict as prd
```
